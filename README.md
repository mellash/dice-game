# Cool to have a game that challenges your luck :)

The game is simple, all you had to do is guess a number from 1 to 6, and wait the dice to roll. If the number you guessed is the same as the number rolled by the dice, you win! Otherwise, you lose. By default you have 1000$ to play, and each time you win the bet get tripled, and each time you lose you lose the amount you bet. You can play as long as you have money to bet.
